## Re-evaluating retinopathy

Here you will find the code required to reproduce the analyses in our paper.

In order to ensure our analysis is fully reproducible, the files are provided Quarto documents, with annotations explaining the steps taken and why.

In order to run the analysis yourself you should:

1) Download the Quarto files from this repository or the archived equivalent over at Zenodo. These should all be placed in a single directory.
2) Download the data files, which were published alongside the manuscript. These should be placed in a separate directory named 'AnonData'. This directory should be stored in the same location as the directory of Quarto documents.
3) Open S1 Analysis Quarto document in R Studio and hit 'Run All'. This is essential to generate the data objects required for S2 Analysis.
4) Run other Quarto documents as required!

If it doesn't work then feel free to contact us using the contact details provided in the manuscript. 

Thanks!
